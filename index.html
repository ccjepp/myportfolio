                    <strong>Application Support (Unix/SQL)</strong>
                    <p>Vertere Global Solutions, Inc. - July 2023 to Present</p>
                    <p>I provide essential technical assistance to application and business users. My responsibilities include analyzing and optimizing code, testing and deploying code changes, coordinating with external vendors to address application issues, and actively participating in projects where I take on roles such as Designer, Tester, Software Architect, and Implementer.

My strengths lie in my strong analytical skills, excellent English communication (both written and oral), and proficiency in UNIX Korn/Bourne shell scripting and SQL.</p>

                    <strong>Managed Service Operations, Associate</strong>
                    <p>MSCI Inc. - July 2020 to July 2023</p>
                    <p>As an Associate in Managed Service Operations at MSCI Inc., I played a critical role in ensuring the uninterrupted functioning of application services and events round the clock. This involved vigilantly monitoring and managing systems using various monitoring and ticketing tools. Additionally, I took charge of overseeing CA Workflow automations (Autosys), Airflow workflow job monitoring, and promptly addressing issues, particularly those related to environment restarts.</p>

<p>Effective communication and collaboration were key aspects of my role, as I coordinated maintenance activities and outages with multiple teams, including infrastructure, application management, and TCS teams. In the event of technical issues in Unix/Linux and Windows environments, I conducted initial investigations and resolutions, closely monitored server alerts, and liaised with backup teams to ensure service continuity.</p>

<p>In my client-facing responsibilities, I responded to inquiries and requests directly through phone, email, and our ticket tracking systems, Salesforce and ServiceNow. Moreover, I proactively identified opportunities for process improvements, translating them into actionable knowledge base pages, and conducted training sessions for my team, soliciting feedback to guarantee the effective implementation of enhancements.</p>

<p>Efficiency was at the forefront of my contributions, where I adeptly implemented new client workflow processes, ensuring they complied with service level agreements (SLAs) and aligning with technical documentation. I also estimated expected durations and output for workflows by identifying job dependencies. Collaboratively, I worked with internal teams to enhance our monitoring system, actively identifying areas that could be automated to boost both efficiency and accuracy, thus contributing to the overall operational excellence of our team and organization.</p>
